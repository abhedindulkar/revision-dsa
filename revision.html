            PROBLEM STATEMENT
            Get max difference of the array
            condition: left < right

            eg stock buy and sell.

            https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/submissions/

            solution 1:
            use carry forward technique from right to left

            solution 2:
            use 2 pointer technique
            left should be at minimum and right to be incremented using for loop!
            if current is minimum than left then update left and if not then check difference > maxProfit
        </max_difference>
        problem
        sum of max - min of subsequence in array
        use sorting and count 
    </array>
    <stack>
        using mod and quotient for storing 2 values, u will need a constant here we take 11 (Elements max + 1) like the 1 <= values <= 10 ;
        7 & 10
        ans = 7 (11) + 10 = 87;
        value1 = 87/11 = 7;
        value2 = 87 % 11 = 10;

        7 & 7  , c = 15
        ans = 7(15) + 7  = 105;
        value 1 = 112 / 15 = 7;
        value 2 = 105 % 15 = 7;
